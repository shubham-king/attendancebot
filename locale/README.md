## Things to remember when translating
- Use `en.json` as the template
- Check `en.json` for any changes/updates
- Do not forget to change language info (Name, Short, and Icon)
- Variables are represented as `%{x}`. Do not change their name
- Always create a seperate branch for translations
- Merge requests target should be `develop`
- Good luck!
